## Task 3 — Evidence Integrity Checks (Retractions & Predatory Flags) ✅

**Goal**: Implement comprehensive evidence integrity checking system to detect retracted publications and predatory journals, with admin management capabilities.

### ✅ **Completed Implementation**

**1) Database Schema Extension** ✅
- ✅ **Flags Column**: Added `flags JSONB` column to `search_results` table with GIN index for efficient querying
- ✅ **Journal Blocklist**: Created `journal_blocklist` table with ISSN tracking, notes, and audit trail
- ✅ **User Relations**: Extended User model to include journal blocklist management relations
- ✅ **Migration**: Applied database migration with proper indexes and constraints

**2) Integrity Detection Service** ✅
- ✅ **Retraction Detection**: Comprehensive retraction detection from PubMed and Crossref sources
- ✅ **PubMed Integration**: Detection via PublicationType and CommentsCorrectionsList
- ✅ **Crossref Integration**: Detection via relation types and subtype indicators
- ✅ **Predatory Journal Detection**: Blocklist-based detection with configurable policies
- ✅ **Confidence Scoring**: High/medium/low confidence levels for detected flags
- ✅ **Source Tracking**: Detailed source attribution for each detected flag

**3) Admin Management System** ✅
- ✅ **Journal Blocklist CRUD**: Complete CRUD operations for managing predatory journal lists
- ✅ **Search & Pagination**: Advanced search capabilities with pagination support
- ✅ **User Attribution**: Full audit trail with user attribution for blocklist entries
- ✅ **Integrity Statistics**: Comprehensive statistics dashboard for project integrity metrics
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for all admin operations

**4) Search Pipeline Integration** ✅
- ✅ **Automatic Detection**: Integrity flags automatically detected during search result ingestion
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch processing with error handling
- ✅ **Flag Storage**: Flags stored with search results for persistent integrity tracking
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Optimized processing with smaller batch sizes for integrity checks

**5) Results API Enhancement** ✅
- ✅ **Flag Inclusion**: Search results API now includes integrity flags in responses
- ✅ **Filtering Options**: Advanced filtering by integrity status (excludeFlagged, flaggedOnly, retractedOnly, predatoryOnly)
- ✅ **Import Integration**: Search result import preserves integrity flags in candidate records
- ✅ **JSONB Queries**: Efficient PostgreSQL JSONB queries for flag-based filtering

**6) Testing Infrastructure** ✅
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all integrity detection functions
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Full integration tests for admin API endpoints
- ✅ **Edge Case Testing**: Tests for various retraction and predatory detection scenarios
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation testing

### ✅ **Technical Implementation Details**

**Integrity Detection Features:**
- **Multi-Source Detection**: PubMed and Crossref retraction detection with extensible architecture
- **Publication Type Analysis**: Detection via PubMed PublicationTypeList indicators
- **Comment Analysis**: Detection via PubMed CommentsCorrectionsList retraction notices
- **Relation Analysis**: Detection via Crossref relation types and subtype indicators
- **Blocklist Management**: Admin-managed predatory journal detection with full CRUD operations

**Database Design:**
- **JSONB Flags**: Flexible flag storage with GIN indexing for efficient queries
- **Audit Trail**: Complete user attribution and timestamp tracking
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper referential integrity with cascade operations
- **Index Optimization**: Strategic indexing for performance and query efficiency

**API Design:**
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Clean, consistent API design following REST principles
- **Advanced Filtering**: Multiple filtering options for integrity-based result queries
- **Pagination Support**: Efficient pagination for large result sets
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

**Performance Features:**
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch processing during search result ingestion
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking integrity detection during search operations
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful error handling that doesn't break search operations

### ✅ **Verification Results**

**✅ Integrity Detection Confirmed**:
- Retraction detection working for PubMed and Crossref sources
- Predatory journal detection via admin-managed blocklist
- Confidence scoring and source attribution functional
- Automatic flag application during search result ingestion

**✅ Admin Management Confirmed**:

- Edge cases properly handled with appropriate error responses
- Performance tests confirming efficient batch processing

**Commands to Test Integrity System:**
```bash
# Test integrity detection
pnpm test src/services/integrity.test.ts

# Test admin API
pnpm test src/routes/admin.test.ts

# Test build
pnpm build
```

**API Usage:**
```bash
# Get integrity statistics
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/integrity-stats/{projectId}

# List journal blocklist
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/journal-blocklist

# Add journal to blocklist
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/journal-blocklist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"issn": "1234-5678", "note": "Known predatory journal", "addedBy": "user-id"}'

# Filter results by integrity
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/results?excludeFlagged=true"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/results?retractedOnly=true"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/results?predatoryOnly=true"
```

**Status**: **COMPLETE** - Evidence integrity checks system fully implemented and tested.
