# Development Progress

## Task 0 - Fix Prisma 1:1 relation and migrate ✅
- Fixed Prisma schema by renaming `model Prisma` to `model PrismaData` to avoid reserved keyword
- Updated Project.prisma relation to use PrismaData
- Fixed seed script to use prismaData instead of prisma
- Migration and seeding now work successfully
- Database is now in sync with schema and contains sample data

## Task 1 - Add missing API endpoints to match spec v1.2 ✅
- Added ledger routes: GET/POST /projects/:id/ledger/claims, POST /projects/:id/ledger/supports
- Added PRISMA endpoint: GET /projects/:id/prisma
- Fixed Prisma model references from 'prisma' to 'prismaData' in screen routes
- Added strict Zod validation for all new endpoints
