# Writing Style Guide

- Tone: clear, concise; avoid unnecessary jargon.
- Audience: clinicians and researchers.
- Citation policy: DOI or PMID preferred; use OA-first sources.
- Conflict-of-interest: include disclosure placeholders when applicable.
- Match schema fields 1:1: Alignment Packet, Evidence Decision Card, PRISMA Record.
- No links to external services; no PII; no secrets.
