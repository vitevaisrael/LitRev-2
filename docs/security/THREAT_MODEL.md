# Threat Model

## Overview

This document outlines the threat model for the LitRev-2 application using the STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).

## System Architecture

### Components
- **Frontend (Web)**: React-based SPA
- **Backend (Server)**: Fastify API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis with BullMQ
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage
- **External APIs**: PubMed, Crossref, OpenAI

### Data Flow
1. Users authenticate via JWT tokens
2. API requests are rate-limited and validated
3. Data is stored in PostgreSQL with audit logging
4. Background jobs are processed via Redis queues
5. Files are stored in S3 with signed URLs

## Threat Analysis

### 1. Spoofing (Authentication)

**Threat**: Unauthorized access through credential theft or session hijacking

**Assets at Risk**:
- User accounts and sessions
- Admin privileges
- API access tokens

**Mitigations**:
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Secure cookie handling
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session timeout mechanisms

**Risk Level**: Medium

### 2. Tampering (Data Integrity)

**Threat**: Unauthorized modification of data

**Assets at Risk**:
- Research data and citations
- User profiles and projects
- System configuration
- Audit logs

**Mitigations**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- File upload validation and virus scanning
- Immutable audit logs
- Data integrity checks
- CSRF protection

**Risk Level**: High

### 3. Repudiation (Non-repudiation)

**Threat**: Users denying actions they performed

**Assets at Risk**:
- User actions and decisions
- Data modifications
- System access

**Mitigations**:
- Comprehensive audit logging
- User action tracking
- Timestamped records
- Immutable log storage
- User session tracking

**Risk Level**: Low

### 4. Information Disclosure (Confidentiality)

**Threat**: Unauthorized access to sensitive information

**Assets at Risk**:
- User research data
- Personal information
- System internals
- API keys and secrets

**Mitigations**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure API endpoints
- Environment variable protection
- Input/output validation
- Error message sanitization

**Risk Level**: High

### 5. Denial of Service (Availability)

**Threat**: System unavailability or performance degradation

**Assets at Risk**:
- API availability
- Database performance
- External service dependencies
- Storage access

**Mitigations**:
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching
- Graceful error handling
- Health checks and monitoring
- Resource quotas

**Risk Level**: Medium

### 6. Elevation of Privilege (Authorization)

**Threat**: Unauthorized access to higher privilege levels

**Assets at Risk**:
- Admin functions
- System configuration
- Other users' data
- External service access

**Mitigations**:
- Role-based access control
- Principle of least privilege
- Input validation
- Authorization checks on all endpoints
- Admin action logging
- Regular privilege audits

**Risk Level**: Medium

## Security Controls

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with expiration
- Multi-factor authentication (future)

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (database)
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- Secure file handling

### Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Error handling

### Monitoring & Logging
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security event monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Access logging

### Infrastructure Security
- Environment variable protection
- Secure configuration management
- Regular security updates
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security (if applicable)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Data tampering and information disclosure
- External API dependencies
- File upload security

### Medium Risk
- Authentication bypass
- Denial of service attacks
- Privilege escalation

### Low Risk
- Repudiation attacks
- System availability

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for security functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Vulnerability scanning
- Dependency checking

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing
- Security code review
- Configuration review
- User acceptance testing

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Automated monitoring alerts
- User reports
- Security scanning results
- Performance anomalies

### Response
1. Immediate containment
2. Impact assessment
3. Evidence preservation
4. User notification
5. System restoration
6. Post-incident review

### Recovery
- Data backup and restoration
- System hardening
- Security updates
- Process improvements

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data minimization principles
- User consent management
- Right to deletion

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security assessments
- Documentation maintenance

## Future Improvements

### Short Term
- Enhanced input validation
- Improved error handling
- Security headers implementation
- Rate limiting refinement

### Long Term
- Multi-factor authentication
- Advanced threat detection
- Security automation
- Compliance monitoring
- Zero-trust architecture
